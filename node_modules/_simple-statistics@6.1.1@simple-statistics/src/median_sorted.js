/**
 * The [median](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) is
 * the middle number of a list. This is often a good indicator of 'the middle'
 * when there are outliers that skew the `mean()` value.
 * This is a [measure of central tendency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency):
 * a method of finding a typical or central value of a set of numbers.
 *
 * The median isn't necessarily one of the elements in the list: the value
 * can be the average of two elements if the list has an even length
 * and the two central values are different.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} sorted input
 * @returns {number} median value
 * @example
 * medianSorted([10, 2, 5, 100, 2, 1]); // => 52.5
