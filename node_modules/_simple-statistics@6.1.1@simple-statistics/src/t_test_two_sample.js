/**
 * This is to compute [two sample t-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test).
 * Tests whether "mean(X)-mean(Y) = difference", (
 * in the most common case, we often have `difference == 0` to test if two samples
 * are likely to be taken from populations with the same mean value) with
 * no prior knowledge on standard deviations of both samples
 * other than the fact that they have the same standard deviation.
 *
 * Usually the results here are used to look up a
 * [p-value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), which, for
 * a certain level of significance, will let you determine that the
 * null hypothesis can or cannot be rejected.
 *
 * `diff` can be omitted if it equals 0.
 *
 * [This is used to confirm or deny](http://www.monarchlab.org/Lab/Research/Stats/2SampleT.aspx)
 * a null hypothesis that the two populations that have been sampled into
 * `sampleX` and `sampleY` are equal to each other.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} sampleX a sample as an array of numbers
 * @param {Array<number>} sampleY a sample as an array of numbers
 * @param {number} [difference=0]
 * @returns {number|null} test result
 *
 * @example
 * tTestTwoSample([1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6], 0); // => -2.1908902300206643
