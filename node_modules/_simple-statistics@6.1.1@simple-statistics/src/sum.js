/**
 * Our default sum is the [Kahan-Babuska algorithm](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1760/7d467cda1d0277ad272deb2113533131dc09.pdf).
 * This method is an improvement over the classical
 * [Kahan summation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm).
 * It aims at computing the sum of a list of numbers while correcting for
 * floating-point errors. Traditionally, sums are calculated as many
 * successive additions, each one with its own floating-point roundoff. These
 * losses in precision add up as the number of numbers increases. This alternative
 * algorithm is more accurate than the simple way of calculating sums by simple
 * addition.
 *
 * This runs on `O(n)`, linear time in respect to the array.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x input
 * @return {number} sum of all input numbers
 * @example
 * sum([1, 2, 3]); // => 6
